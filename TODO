* Find a way to get the port number from /etc/default/geneweb for the
menu entry. I tried command="/usr/bin/www-browser
http://localhost:`cat /etc/default/geneweb |grep -e '^PORT'| cut -f2
-d'='`" in menu entry but this does not seem to work..:-(

* Really deal with permissions : users should not be able to write
other's databases
