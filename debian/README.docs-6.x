As of the 6.x version of geneweb, upstream stopped providing
documentation with the package. The rationale is that documentations
in the 5.x version is too outdated when it comes at 6.x.

As a consequence, Geneweb official documentation is now available
online at http://geneweb.org

This is tracked in upstream bug #147:
https://github.com/geneweb/geneweb/issues/147
