Template: geneweb/remainingdir
Type: note
_Description: Old directory /var/geneweb not removed
 Previous versions of both official and unofficial packages for Geneweb
 used non FHS-compliant /var/geneweb directory for storing databases.
 .
 It has been detected that this directory was used on your system. Some
 files have been moved from there to /var/lib/geneweb but the geneweb
 installation scripts found some unexpected files in /var/geneweb.
 .
 Thus the directory has been left intact. It is highly recommended that you
 check the remaining files there and move them to /var/lib/geneweb, then
 remove the /var/geneweb directory.

Template: geneweb/remove_databases
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Remove Geneweb database directory on package purge?
 Geneweb's databases will be stored in the database directory /var/lib/geneweb.
 These databases may be put there by authorized users who must be members of
 the "geneweb" group.
 .
 Please choose whether you want to remove databases automatically when
 purging the package (completely removing it).
 .
 THIS WOULD ERASE USER-OWNED DATA. You have to be sure if you accept the
 purge.
 .
 Note that if this directory is empty at the time you purge or simply
 remove the package, it will always be automatically removed.
