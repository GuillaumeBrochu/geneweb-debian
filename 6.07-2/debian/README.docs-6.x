As of the 6.x version of geneweb, upstream stopped providing
documentation with the package. The rationale is that documentations
in the 5.x version is too outdated when it comes at 6.x.

As a consequence, Geneweb official documentation is now available
online at http://opensource.geneanet.org/projects/geneweb/wiki/En_Home 

This is tracked in upstream bug #144:
